### Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Assignment

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

### Download and load data
Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
Load the activity and feature info
Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset

### Steps and instruction of this assignment
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Use command rbind to combine training and test set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Use grep command to get column indexes for   variable name contains "mean()" or "std()"
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Convert activity labels to characters and add a new column as factor
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Give the selected descriptive names to variable columns
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Use pipeline command to create a new tidy dataset with command group_by and summarize_each in dplyr package

### Final output file
The end result is shown in the file tidydata.txt.
